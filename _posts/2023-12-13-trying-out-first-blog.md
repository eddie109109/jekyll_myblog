#### I am just testing different kinds of features in my new blog:
---

### Code
```python
print("hello, world")
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```

```c++
int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, world" << std::endl;
}
```
---
### Math
This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using [MathJax 3](https://www.mathjax.org/) engine. You just need to surround your math expression with `$$`, like `$$ E = mc^2 $$`. If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like $$ E = mc^2 $$.

To use display mode, again surround your expression with `$$` and place it as a separate paragraph. Here is an example:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^\infty |\langle x, e_k \rangle|^2 \leq \|x\|^2
$$

### Photos

The rest of the images in this post are all zoomable, arranged into different mini-galleries.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/12.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/7.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    
</div>
<div class="caption">
    A simple, elegant caption looks good between image rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all.

### Diagrams 

##### Mermaid

Install mermaid using `node.js` package manager `npm` by running the following command:
```bash
npm install -g mermaid.cli
```

The diagram below was generated by the following code:

{% raw %}
```
{% mermaid %}
sequenceDiagram
    participant John
    participant Alice
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    John-->>Alice: Great!
{% endmermaid %}
```
{% endraw %}

{% mermaid %}

    participant John
    participant Alice
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    John-->>Alice: Great!
{% endmermaid %}

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.html path="assets/video/pexels-engin-akyurt-6069112-960x540-30fps.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true autoplay=true %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    A simple, elegant caption looks good between video rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all.

### Audios

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include audio.html path="assets/audio/epicaly-short-113909.mp3" controls=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include audio.html path="https://cdn.pixabay.com/download/audio/2022/06/25/audio_69a61cd6d6.mp3" controls=true %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

### Table

```markdown
| Left aligned | Center aligned | Right aligned |
| :----------- | :------------: | ------------: |
| Left 1       | center 1       | right 1       |
| Left 2       | center 2       | right 2       |
| Left 3       | center 3       | right 3       |
```
That will generate:

| Left aligned | Center aligned | Right aligned |
| :----------- | :------------: | ------------: |
| Left 1       | center 1       | right 1       |
| Left 2       | center 2       | right 2       |
| Left 3       | center 3       | right 3       |

and differnet kinds of tables

{% raw  %}
```html
<table
  id="table"
  data-toggle="table"
  data-url="{{ '/assets/json/table_data.json' | relative_url }}">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th data-field="id">ID</th>
      <th data-field="name">Item Name</th>
      <th data-field="price">Item Price</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
</table>
```
{% endraw  %}

### Jupyter notebook

To include a jupyter notebook in a post, you can use the following code:

{% raw %}

```html
{::nomarkdown}
{% assign jupyter_path = "assets/jupyter/blog.ipynb" | relative_url %}
{% capture notebook_exists %}{% file_exists assets/jupyter/blog.ipynb %}{% endcapture %}
{% if notebook_exists == "true" %}
    {% jupyter_notebook jupyter_path %}
{% else %}
    <p>Sorry, the notebook you are looking for does not exist.</p>
{% endif %}
{:/nomarkdown}
```

{% endraw %}

Let's break it down: this is possible thanks to [Jekyll Jupyter Notebook plugin](https://github.com/red-data-tools/jekyll-jupyter-notebook) that allows you to embed jupyter notebooks in your posts. It basically calls [`jupyter nbconvert --to html`](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#convert-html) to convert the notebook to an html page and then includes it in the post. Since [Kramdown](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/markdown/) is the default Markdown renderer for Jekyll, we need to surround the call to the plugin with the [::nomarkdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#extensions) tag so that it stops processing this part with Kramdown and outputs the content as-is.

The plugin takes as input the path to the notebook, but it assumes the file exists. If you want to check if the file exists before calling the plugin, you can use the `file_exists` filter. This avoids getting a 404 error from the plugin and ending up displaying the main page inside of it instead. If the file does not exist, you can output a message to the user. The code displayed above outputs the following:

{::nomarkdown}
{% assign jupyter_path = "assets/jupyter/blog.ipynb" | relative_url %}
{% capture notebook_exists %}{% file_exists assets/jupyter/blog.ipynb %}{% endcapture %}
{% if notebook_exists == "true" %}
    {% jupyter_notebook jupyter_path %}
{% else %}
    <p>Sorry, the notebook you are looking for does not exist.</p>
{% endif %}
{:/nomarkdown}

Note that the jupyter notebook supports both light and dark themes.
